# Iris Classification Model with Decision Tree

## Overview

This repository contains a machine learning model built on the Iris dataset using a decision tree algorithm. The goal of the project is to classify iris flowers into three species (setosa, versicolor, and virginica) based on their sepal and petal measurements.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Iris dataset, a well-known dataset in the machine learning community. It includes the following features:

- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width

The target variable is the species of iris, with three possible classes: setosa, versicolor, and virginica.

## Model

The classification model is implemented using a decision tree algorithm, which learns to classify iris flowers based on the provided features. The model is trained on a portion of the dataset and evaluated on another to assess its performance.

## Tools and Libraries

- **Python**: The programming language used for the project.
- **Scikit-learn**: The machine learning library used for implementing the decision tree algorithm.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Notebooks are available in the `notebooks` directory for data exploration, model training, and evaluation.
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn**: Utilized for data visualization and creating plots to analyze the dataset.

## Notebooks

- `1_Data_Exploration.ipynb`: Notebook for exploring and analyzing the Iris dataset.
- `2_Model_Training.ipynb`: Notebook for training the decision tree classification model.

## Usage

To run the project:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/iris-decision-tree.git
    cd iris-decision-tree
    ```

2. Open and run the Jupyter Notebooks in the `notebooks` directory to explore the data and train the decision tree model.

3. Experiment with different parameters and features to optimize the model's performance.

## Results

The trained decision tree model and evaluation results can be found in the `models` directory.
